# learn-redux

Me following this [tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwheJHvseC3I0HuYI2f46oAK) by Codevolution + Redux Toolkit [docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start).

For documentation and made to be more neat for easier read in the future.

Might be helpful to go back to older commits.
